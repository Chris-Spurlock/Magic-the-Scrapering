# Magic-the-Scrapering
Scraping *Magic: The Gathering*'s Gatherer card database for further analysis.

## About the Project

Using the **BeautifulSoup** library in Python, I'm extracting the html of search results in the [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) card database to scrape information about each Magic card, including:
- Name of card
- Card type and subtype
- Card text
- Card mana cost
- Card mana color

## About Magic

*Magic: The Gathering* is a collectible card game originally released in 1993. Since this initial release they have published over 100 expansions consisting of over 20,000 unique cards. Most cards in the game are *spells* cast by powerful wizards known as *planeswalkers* (AKA the players). Over the years this game has captured the heart of many a nerd (including myself), and as of 2018, [there are over 35 million planeswalkers around the globe](https://www.businessinsider.com/magic-the-gathering-announces-10-million-esports-program-for-2019-2018-12#:~:text=Magic%20the%20Gathering%20is%20one,players%20spread%20across%2070%20countries.).
